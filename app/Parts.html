        <h1>Parts</h1>

        <p>
          Laccases can be found among many different organisms such as fungi,
          bacteria and even plants. Fungal laccases come up with a higher
          activity, higher redox potentials and wider substrate range compared
          to bacterial laccases. They are also more active at lower temperatures
          which can be found, for instance, in wastewater. On the other hand,
          bacterial laccases are more stable regarding high salt concentrations
          and are especially easier to produce.1,2
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to investigate the degradation of diclofenac and
          carbamazepine within our approach, two laccases were evaluated. The
          first laccase tested was an eukaryotic fungal laccase of Trametes
          versicolor which has already been shown to degrade diclofenac.3
          Therefore, a Biobrick contributed by the iGEM-Team Stockholm 2018 (the
          laccase with a his-Tag) was further improved by adding a poly-Lys-Tag
          which should facilitate the immobilization within the Mesocellular
          Silica Foam (MCF). The second laccase we used in this study was a less
          known bacterial laccase derived from Streptomyces cyaneus. Its
          performance regarding degradation of the substrates of interest was
          assessed, since a prokaryotic laccase would provide benefits regarding
          costs and duration of expression compared to an eukaryotic laccase.
          Additionally, we added a his-Tag for clean-up and the poly-Lys-Tag for
          improved immobilization conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Parts</h2>
        <p>We want to contribute two parts to the iGEM Biobrick-Library.</p>

        <h3>New Biobrick:</h3>
        <p>
          We want to contribute another laccase to the iGEM-Biobricks. This one
          is derived from Streptomyces cyaneus and is not as well studied as the
          laccase of Trametes versicolor. It showed good potential regarding
          activity and stability during ABTS-Assays, so we assessed its
          capability of degrading our substrates of interest. It showed the
          ability to degrade diclofenac. Hence, this Biobrick could be a
          suitable addition to wastewater treatment approaches through
          immobilized enzymes. Furthermore, a bacterial host allows cheaper and
          faster expression compared to expression in eukaryotic hosts like
          Pichia pastoris.
        </p>

        <p>
          We ordered the sequence from IDT and obtained a pET28a-plasmid by the
          IMB of the University of Stuttgart. After a XbaI and NotI digestion
          and subsequent ligation, the ligation product was transformed in
          competent DH5α-E coli cells. We screened for positive clones, isolated
          the pET28a-lacSc vector and verified successful cloning via
          sequencing. The expression was performed in the E coli strain BL21.
          The resulting protein lysate showed good potential regarding stability
          and activity for our immobilization approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Biobrick is the DNA-sequence of the laccase of S cyaneus. In
          addition, there is a 6xhis-tag at the C-terminus of the sequence and a
          6xlys-tag at the N-terminus of the protein. The his-tag should allow
          purification of the laccase while the lys-tag could possibly improve
          the immobilization process through providing free amino-groups.
        </p>

        <h3>Improvement of Biobrick:</h3>

        <p>
          It is an alteration of an already existing part. It´s a laccase of T.
          versicolor which was contributed by the iGEM-Team Stockholm 2018. We
          added a poly-lysine-tag at the C-terminus of the laccase sequence to
          investigate its influence on the immobilization process.
