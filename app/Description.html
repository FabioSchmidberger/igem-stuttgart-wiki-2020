        <h1>LAC‌ ‌MAN‌ - Description</h1>

        <p>
          Water is the basis of all life on our planet. Whether plants, animals,
          humans or microorganisms, we all depend on it for our survival. Water
          scarcity and purity worldwide cause conflicts. Above all, water
          pollution from drugs, such as antibiotics or estrogen derivatives and
          other non-medical pollutants is proving to be an emerging issue in
          industrialized countries. For this reason, in 2013 the EU Parliament
          adopted a directive on the constant analysis of water within the Union
          [1]. This so-called “watch list” was first evaluated in 2018 by the
          Joint Research Center [2]. The frequent exceedance of the Predicted
          No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) for 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was
          particularly noticeable. In addition to EE2, the watch list includes
          other potentially dangerous substances for humans and the environment,
          such as antibiotics and diclofenac (pain relievers). Many of these
          molecules are characterized by common properties. Examples include
          aromatic ring structure and their effect as endocrine disruptors (e.g.
          EE2) and / or the toxicity of these compounds (e.g. diclofenac,
          carbamazepine), which justify the hazard potential for humans and
          animals [3].
        </p>

        <h2>Why laccases?</h2>
        <p>
          Aromatic ring structures serve as potential targets for enzymes, the
          so-called laccases, that have been identified in various fungi and
          bacteria. Laccases oxidize phenol groups, creating phenoxyl radicals.
          Four oxidized electrons are stored and transferred via the copper
          cluster onto free molecular oxygen, which is reduced to water. The
          degradation products produced here have no negative effects on people
          and the environment [4]. Our goal was to improve the stability of
          these enzymes and by using our selected laccases of T. versicolor and
          S. cyaneus to neutralize a large number of pollutants due to their
          wide range of substrates.
        </p>

        <h2>How is laccase synthesized?</h2>
        <p>
          The laccases are produced using a classic biotechnological approach,
          in which the insert DNA T. versicolor or S.cyaneus and the expression
          vectors pPICZalpha or PET28 are amplified via PCR using primers for a
          subsequent gibson assembly and then assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi
          DNA Assembly Cloning Kit #E5520S. This is used to transform competent
          E.coli cells. The expression vector pPICZalpha is integrated into the
          genome in order to generate a stable expression strain [6]. Because
          the above Laccase T. versicolor has several disulfide bridges,
          production in eukaryotic cells is necessary. The Pichia pastoris X33
          strain has been successfully used for the synthesis of laccases.
        </p>

        <h2>Why immobilization?</h2>
        <p>
          Immobilization using a mesoporous silica foam is suitable to make the
          laccases sustainable on the long run [7, 8]. Silicon-based materials
          are well suited because they are environmentally friendly,
          biocompatible and, above all, resistant to organic solvents and
          microbial attacks. Furthermore, the immobilization makes the laccases
          pH- and thermostable. In addition, immobilized enzymes have a halflife
          up to 18 times longer [9]. At the same time, the enzymes used are
          firmly bound to the matrix and therefore do not have to be filtered
          out of the wastewater again. This process also has the advantage that
          no genetically modified organisms can be released into the
          environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Innovation</h2>
        <p>
          Immobilizing enzymes on a mesoporous silica matrix via amino groups on
          their surface and glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent was reported
          to significantly decrease enzyme activity [10]. Because the active
          site could be sterically blocked by the immobilization process, we
          came up with the idea of adding a poly-Lysine-tag at the c-terminus of
          the laccase. In doing so, the immobilization rate near the active site
          is reduced and the structure of the laccase would remain almost
          unchanged, resembling the free enzyme.
        </p>

        <p>
          How did we estimate the amount of immobilized enzyme needed? In order
          to be able to analyze the properties of our foam and the immobilized
          laccases in regard to substrate conversion, we established a kinetic
          model according to Michaelis-Menten. In doing so, the foam is
          simulated by aligned compartments which represent a substrate
          concentration gradient inside the foam. This substrate conversion
          kinetic is further complemented by equations modelling
          temperature-dependence and other important parameters.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Could be applied in wastewater treatment plants, efflux of pharma
          companies and hospitals.
