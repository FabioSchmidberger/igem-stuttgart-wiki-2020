        <h1>Collaborations</h1>

        <p>
          As a contribution for future iGEM Teams, we want to show you how to
          synthesize a mesoporous silica foam (MSF) to immobilize enzymes.
          Through immobilization, the stability of the enzymes increase
          regarding pH-value and temperature. We immobilized Laccases so they
          can be reused and are not released into the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Synthesis</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>8 g Pluoronic P123</li>
          <li>HCl solution (11,75 ml HCl in 282,5 ml water)</li>
          <li>13,88 ml Mesitylene</li>
          <li>93,4 mg NH4F</li>
          <li>18,14 ml TEOS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To synthesize the MSF 8 g Pluoronic P123 was dissolved in 294,25 ml
          HCl solution (11,75 ml HCl in 282,5 ml water). After the Pluoronic
          P123 was dissolved completely, 13,88 ml Mesitylene and 93,4 mg NH4F
          were added, the mixture was stirred for one hour at room temperature.
          Afterwards 18,14 ml TEOS were added dropwise to the mixture and
          stirred for 20 hours at 40°C. The next day the temperature was
          increased to 100°C and again stirred for 24 hours. The solid was
          filtered and washed with Ethanol. Afterwards the MSF was dried
          overnight at 60°C.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterwards the MSF was observed by a scanning electron microscope.
          Where we could see the size of the pores, which are 24 to 30 nm.

        <h2>Experiment set-up</h2>

        <p>
          The experiment was performed in a 500 ml three-necked flask. For
          permanent reflux a return condenser was used and for easier addition a
          dropwise funnel was used. Due to the heating up of hydrochloric acid,
          a washing flask with sodium hydroxide solution was used to neutralize
          the evaporated hydrochloric acid.
        </p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Some safety aspects are really important for the synthesis of the MSF.
          Hydrochloric acid is toxic in its gaseous phase. This is why it is
          important to neutralize the evaporated hydrochloric acid in sodium
          hydroxide solution. The whole experiment is done under an exhaust
          hood. Furthermore, there must be special caution while working with
          Mesitylene and NH4F, these chemicals are toxic and harmful. Wearing
          gloves and safety goggles is recommended. Wash your hands directly
          after coming in contact with these chemicals.
